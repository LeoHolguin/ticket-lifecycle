First, we are going to pretend to be the end user and create tickets so we as an agent can resolve them. After, we are going to log in to one of the agents we created and should be able to see the tickets that were created.

In this situation we going to pick which ticket has the highest priority and by the look of it, it has to be the one that says online banking is down.

Whenever we are making changes to a ticket it notifies the user what we are doing and we can also communicate with them as well if we needed to. Once we resolved the issues we can send them a message stating the problem has been fixed and proceed resolving the ticket. As you can see, the ticket has disappeared but we can still look at our closed tickets in case we need to remember how to solve a new ones for the future.
